\section{Data Mining}
\begin{frame}{Data Mining}
\begin{itemize}
\item Data mining is the study of collecting, cleaning, processing, analyzing, and gaining useful
insight from data.
\item Data mining is a broad term that is used to describe different aspects of data processing
(depending on the problem domain, applications, formulation, and data representations).
\item Data may be arbitrary, unstructured, and even in a format that is not immediately suitable
for automated processing.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{images/DataMining.PNG}
	\label{fig:DataMining}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Classification}
\begin{frame}{Data Mining}{Classification}
\begin{itemize}
\item Classification is a data mining function that assigns items in a collection to target categories or classes. The goal of classification is to accurately predict the target class for each case in the data. For example, a classification model could be used to identify loan applicants as low, medium, or high credit risks.

\item Classifier include a supervised model that can learn from a training data and then classify the test data.

\item A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples.

\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[H]

	\label{fig:Classification}
\end{figure}

\end{frame}
\subsection{Clustring}
\begin{frame}{Data Mining}{Clustering}

\begin{itemize}
\item Clustering is the process of grouping a set of data objects into multiple groups or clusters
so that objects within a cluster have high similarity, but are very dissimilar to objects in
other clusters.
\item Dissimilarities and similarities are assessed based on the attribute values describing the
objects and often involve distance measures.
\item Clustering as a data mining tool has its roots in many application areas such as biology,
security, business intelligence, and Web search.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
\subsection{Association Rule Mining}
\begin{frame}{Data Mining}{Association Rule Mining}
\begin{itemize}
\item The classical problem of associative pattern mining is defined in the context of
supermarket (items bought by customers as transactions).
\item The goal is to determine association between groups of items bought by customers.
\item The most popular model for associative pattern mining uses the frequencies of sets of
items as the quantification of the level of association.
\item The discovered set of items are referred to as large itemsets, frequent itemsets, or
frequent patterns.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{images/Association.PNG}
	\label{fig:Classification}
\end{figure}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item Frequent itemsets can be used to generate association rules of the form
$X => Y$\\
X and Y are set of items.
\item For example, if the supermarket owner discovers the following rule
{Eggs, Milk} $=>$ {Yogurt}
\item As a conclusion, she/he can promote Yogurt to customers who often buy Eggs and Milk.
\item The frequency-based model for associative pattern mining is very popular due to its
simplicity.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\section{Semantic Web Mining}

\begin{frame}{Semantic Web Mining}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Semantic web in data mining
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Concerned with deriving higher-level insights from data
		\item Are knowledge intensive and can often benefit from using additional knowledge from various sources
		\item Document classification, Document clustering
	\end{itemize}
	\item Data mining in semantic web
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Building ontologies is a time consuming task
		\item Data mining techniques could be fruitfully exploited for learning models from existing Web data
		\item Models can be used for building and enriching ontologies from
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{ŸêData mining in Semantic Web}
\begin{frame}{Semantic Web Mining}{Data mining in Semantic Web}
	 \begin{itemize}
		\item In presence of noisy/inconsistent knowledge bases, that could be highly probable in  the Web, deductive reasoning is no more applicable 
		\item inductive reasoning is grounded on the generalization of specific examples (assertions in the SW context) allowing the formulation of conclusions even when inconsistent/noisy knowledge bases are considered
		\item The main focus is on   building the terminology of an ontology while less attention has been dedicated to the enrichment/construction of the assertional part
		\item enrichment/construction of the assertional part, namely the ontology population problem results in an even more time consuming task
	 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Classification}
\begin{frame}{Semantic Web Mining}{Classification}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Ontology population task: the problem has been focused by casting it to a classification problem
	 	\item Requires some assumption
	 		\begin{enumerate}
				\item Open world assumption
				\item Non-disjointness of the classes
				\item the availability of new similarity measures to exploit the expressiveness of DLs 
	 		\end{enumerate}
 		\item Nearest Neighbor (NN) and Support Vector Machine have been used in studies.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\subsection{Clustering}
\begin{frame}{Semantic Web Mining}{Clustering}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Ontology learning task: focuses on learning ontologies (mainly terminologies) from text documents by the use of clustering methods
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Concepts are extracted from documents by the use of Natural Language Processing techniques   
			\item Concept are clustered to obtain an initial terminology 
			\item Enriched with new relationships  by means of association rules
		\end{enumerate}
	\item There are some drawbacks 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Semantic relations among the terms are not fully clear 
			\item Expressiveness of the adopted language is less than OWL
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Association Rule Mining}
\begin{frame}{Semantic Web Mining}{Association Rule Mining}
\begin{itemize}
		 
	\item Accossiation rule mining has following applications in semantic web
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Amending RDF entities 
			\item Finding new relations
			\item Discrimination discovery
			\item Rule discovery
			\item Ontology Alignment
		\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Association Rule Mining}
\subsection{Challenges}
\begin{frame}{Association Rule Mining}{Challenges}
	\begin{itemize}
		 
		\item  DM algorithms input vs ontology repesenation: The usual way to represent these assertions is as triples (subject, predicate, object) the identification of transactions and items is not trivial
		\item Structural heterogeneity issues: OWL is sustained by description logics (DLs), annotated data does not follow a rigid structure. That is, instances belonging to the same OWL class may have different structures
		\item Implicit data: Since DLs are defined with formal semantics, reasoning capabilities must be applied in order to handle the implicit knowledge 
	\end{itemize}

\item  This article attempts to provide a method for structuring such data using the semantic Web.
\item This article, by combining associative rules and fuzzy logic and ontology, provides a methodology to store massive data in a structured format.

\item Mining Rules to Align Knowledge Bases \cite{galarraga2013mining}
\begin{itemize}
\item Different knowledge base can be linked together. These connections can be done at the instance level, but this is difficult at schema level, because of their inheritance structure.
\item There are many knowledge bases, each of which belongs to different companies, and many instances of them overlap, which can be connected to each other.
\item This paper assumes that the mapping is done between the instances and merges two knowledge bases.
\item It mine association rules from that Community of knowledge bases and then align them through beneath rules.

\item Semantic Knowledge Discovery from Heterogeneous Data Sources
Claudia \cite{d2012semantic}
\begin{itemize}
\item This study combines database and ontology data and then mine association rules.
\item A frequent itemset expresses the variables and the corresponding values that occur reasonably often together in database.
\item At the first step integrate ontology and database.
\item Using Apriori frequent itemset extract frequent itemsets and then mine association rules. 
\item Now these extracted rules can help to enrich the database or ontology, or for data analysis and data completion.
